# Ionic-Solid

This is a demonstration of how to build a multi-platform smartfone app with a [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/) backend.

#### How to reproduce

- Start a new app with the Ionic CLI
`ionic start my-app blank`

- Install dependencies
`npm install --save solid-auth-client tripledoc rdf-namespaces @ionic/storage buffer process`

- Add the following to `src/polyfills.ts`:
    ```typescript
    import {Buffer} from 'buffer';
    (window as any).Buffer = Buffer;

    import * as process from 'process';
    (window as any).process = process;

    (window as any).setImmediate = window.setTimeout;
    ```
- add the following to `src/index.html`:
    ```html
    <script>
        var global = global || window;
    </script>
    ```
